	<h3>Definitions</h3>
	<p>
	<strong>Android OS</strong> is a Linux-based mobile operating system that primarily runs on smartphones and tablets.
	</p>
	<p>
	The Android platform includes an operating system based upon the Linux kernel,
	a GUI, a web browser and end-user applications that can be downloaded.
	</p>
	<h3>History and development</h3>
	<p>
	Android began its life as a Palo Alto-based startup company called Android Inc., in 2003. Originally, 
	the company set out to develop an operating system for digital cameras, 
	but it abandoned those efforts in lieu of reaching a broader market.
	Google acquired Android Inc. Google marketed 
	the early mobile platform to handset manufacturers and mobile carriers with its major benefits as flexibility and upgradability.
	</p>
	<h3>Android OS features</h3>
    <p>
	The default UI of Android relies on direct manipulation inputs such as tapping, swiping and pinching to initiate actions.
	The device provides haptic feedback to the user via alerts such as vibrations to respond to actions. 
	If a user presses a navigation button, for example, the device vibrates.
	</p>
	<p>
	when a user boots a device, Android OS displays the home screen,
	which is the primary navigation hub for Android devices and is comprised of widgets and app icons. 
	Widgets are informational displays that automatically update content such as weather or news.
	The home screen display can differ based on the device manufacturer that is running the OS. 
	</p>
